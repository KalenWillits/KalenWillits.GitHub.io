### Data Scientist, Data Analyst, and Python Developer.

Certified data professional with eight years of experience using Excel, three years of Python programming, and one year of hands-on experience working with Windows Administration, databases, data visualization, and machine learning

From 2013 to 2018 I managed a music store in Hawaii where I learned critical small business practices. Once put to the test, I had the pleasure during my last year solving problems that increased gross revenue by nearly 20%. After my time in retail, I pursued aeronautics which allowed me to gain an understanding and passion of science and mathematics.

As a Technical Support Professional III at OpenText, I am a part of the inbound escalations team supporting the Carbonite Safe line of backup software. Customers and clients include both B2C and B2B accounts where we support user endpoint file systems, Windows server operating systems, and SQL database backups. I receive calls only after a tier 1 agent has worked with an account and the agent has determined either by troubleshooting or policy that the account needs to be escalated for further investigation. When receiving escalated accounts, I first determine if all appropriate steps have been taken according to company policy, then use my expert knowledge of the product to troubleshoot environment and application issues.

When I am not taking escalated support calls I am improving our agentâ€™s experience by writing technical articles to add to the internal processes knowledge base. Another opportunity that has been awarded to me is working closely with the products team to develop tools that improve the customer support experience. I only work in prototypes, however a shopping cart calculator that I developed is currently being implemented into production by tools and tech. Because of this development experience and my knowledge of SQL, I spend time shadowing reporting and analytics where we use SQL and Tableau to create data-driven insights for senior-management meetings.

My career track with OpenText has been a fruitful one. I survived the acquisition of Carbonite to OpenText, gained paramount experience from several roles in a cooperate environment, and was awarded with a promotion during a fully remote pandemic. I am extremely grateful for the skills all of my mentors and peers have taught me, however through all the hats I have worn my greatest satisfaction has come from developing solutions to solve a problem. Which is why I have narrowed my focus on developing data driven solutions and continuing to grow in the field of data science.

I was accepted into Springboard's Data Science Career Track in March of 2020 and I earned my data science certificate in October 2020. Here I have worked closely with industry professionals to develop two complete capstone projects using the data science method. My first project was working with historical airline data where I used feature engineering to produce a discrete percentage of flight delays given a geographical scope. The result predicts flight delays at passenger check-in with a simple, easy-to-read ratio of flights delayed within the area. My second capstone utilizes an ensemble method of natural language processing to create real machine understanding of written documents. My dream is to use your smart phone's camera to scan a written document, then users could interact with their digital assistant as if it is an instant-expert on the document. This type of product could alleviate pain points across consumer's and support centers when discussing technical and legal documentation. What I achieved in this project was a very basic machine understanding allowing a prototype chatbot to read in Wikipedia articles and determine if a user's input was true or false according to the read in article. I learned a lot about how close machine learning is getting to a real AI user experience and resources necessary to achieve this goal.


If you have data and that needs cleaning, analysis, or predictive modeling. Feel free to reach out to me for a free consultation and we can discuss how to get the most out of your data.
